I think of myself as an independent learner, but I can be too proud to ask for help. Sometimes it's more efficient to simply ask someone experienced to explain something: they might be able to explain in 10 minutes something that could take me a few hours to figure out on my own. Because I know I have this tendency, I've worked on recognizing when I'm not making progress figuring out a new task and that it's time to ask for someone to explain what I'm missing so I can continue with the rest of my work.


I like to do a lot of research before I start a project because I prefer doing things right the first time. However, sometimes I delayed starting a project for too long because I'm worried I haven't done enough preparation: maybe there's an important article I've missed or I feel like I haven't completely mastered the subject. I now try to recognize that sometimes I simply need to start work and figure things out as I go along because book knowledge can't substitute for experience.
